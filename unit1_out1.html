<h2>Describe the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>

<p>
In the modern world, a highly capable IT team is the lifeblood of your company. In all businesses, big or small, across all industries, having an IT team that is well-trained is crucial to keeping business afloat. Their many responsibilities are integral, even if your company only uses one computer. Today, we’re going to take a closer look at what their common roles are in any business, and hopefully drive home the true gravity of their importance.

Communications
How do people communicate, internally and externally, at your job? Do they use VoIP phone systems? Do they e-mail? What would business be like if these channels suddenly went offline? Not only would collaborating with your coworkers become a pain, your clients would most certainly not be pleased. IT teams are there to troubleshoot – they know the ins and outs of your communication channels, how to keep them up and running, and how to keep your conversations secure. Without them, it would be impossible to operate your business.

<h2>Describe methods, skills & resources needed</h2>

<p>
    According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), a methodology is defined as ‘a system of practices, techniques, procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. Lean practices, Kanban, and Six Sigma are project management methodologies examples.’

    They are essentially processes that aim to assist project managers with guidance throughout the project, and the steps to take to complete the tasks. Different methodologies have different strategies that aid in managing issues should they arise during the project’s delivery.
    
    I will be using the KANBAN method on this project.

<h2>Selecting the Right IT System and Software</h2>

<p>
    If you can select an IT system and software for a project, familiarity should be a major consideration. Becoming adept with unfamiliar software and different system architectures could be time-consuming, and wasteful of time resources.

<h2>Legal guidelines. GDPR definition</h2>

<p>
    One of the primary objectives of GDPR is adjusting the legal regulations concerning the processing and protection of personal data to better fit the challenges of technological development and globalization which have facilitated the unprecedented availability and pervasive use of personal data. Just to be clear, by personal data I mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person—including identifiers such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or, for example, factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
