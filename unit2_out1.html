    <h2>Copyright and Other Constraints</h2>
    
    <p>
        As a general rule, it is wise to operate under the assumption that all works are protected by either copyright or trademark law unless conclusive information indicates otherwise. A work is not in the public domain simply because it has been posted on the Internet (a popular fallacy) or because it lacks a copyright notice (another myth).
    </p>
    
    <h2>Access Issues/Visual Impairment</h2>
    
    <p>
    The W3c has offered webmasters these ten tips:
    
    Provide Alt Text For all images, and alternative content for all other media.
    Use eternal CSS for styling and layout and HTML for document structure.
    Associate table headers with table cells, and use tables only for data. Include a table summary.
    Provide a skip links option to let a user skip repetitive content.
    Do not use flash, frames or tables for layout purposes.
    Design for device independence. Don’t require a mouse and don’t require javascript to activate links etc.
    Use simple language on your website, and specify the language used.
    Make sure colours and fonts contrast sufficiently.
    Do not fix a font size on your website. Use % or ems.
    Use a fluid layout, using percentages or ems for width.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Appropriate Filetypes for Websites</h2>
    
    <p>
    Image file types on the web
    Digital images exist as files on a computer and there are a variety of different image file types (or formats) that are used for different purposes. The easiest way to identify what file type an image exists in is to look at the file extension (the three letter suffix appended to the end of the file name).
    
    The picture below shows the same image saved in three different image file formats. GIF (file extension .gif), JPEG (file extension .jpg) and PNG (file extension .png). The associated graphical icons may vary from computer to computer. Also, depending on your computer’s settings, file extensions may be hidden.
    
    Choosing the correct file type for your image
    There are many different image file types available. However every image file type has a specific purpose and only a small number of them can be used on the web.
    
    GIF vs. JPEG
    Traditionally the two most common file types used on the web are GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) and JPEG (Joint Picture Experts Group) and these are the formats that you should use when creating web graphics. However these file types are not interchangeable. GIF and JPEG are used for different types of images and you must know which is the most appropriate to use for your particular image. The table below will help you choose which file type you should use and why. [1]
