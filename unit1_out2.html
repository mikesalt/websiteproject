<h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools</h2>

<p>I have found Trello to be useful but time-consuming. 
   Visual Studio is an excellent tool, I found it intuitive and productive.


</p>

<h2>Were the IT tools Selected Appropriate</h2>

<p>
    I am satisfied that the tools I used ie. Trello & Visual Studio were appropriate and productive.
</p>

<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses of My Final Project</h2>

<p>
    I am reasonably satisfied with my website.
    I would like to have had the opportunity to increase my coding knowledge and produce a better website, but due to the short length of the course, this was not possible.
</p>

<h2>Further Improvements to My Project</h2>

<p>
    I intend to increase my knowledge of HTML & CSS and improve the design and functionality of my website.
    Add video links, external site links and interactive aspects to keep visitors attention.
</p>

<h2>Review Outcomes</h2>

<p>
    As stated previously, I am happy with my website as a base for expansion.
    I look forward to adding functionality and aesthetic improvements.
