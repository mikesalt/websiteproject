    <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review)</h2>

    <h2>Review the benifits of IT tools</h2>
    
    <p>
        I feel that use of IT tools and systems will greatly increase productivity and efficiency, particularly in larger projects with multiple team members.
        All team members being given the ability to refer to and build upon an agreed design in a structured fashion.
        I'm unsure whether this project would have benefited from a team-based approach, mainly due to time constraints.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ways to Improve Productivity and Efficiency</h2>
    
    <p>
        Increased knowledge and experience will obviously improve productivity and efficiency. Also access to and proficiency with available tools and systems.
        Also being able to draw on the expertise and experience of fellow team members could be a great source of inspiration.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Develop Solutions to Improve My Own Productivity</h2>
    
    <p>
        Continually research and add to my knowledge of coding and design.
        Keep abreast of developments in coding and technology.
        Communicate with others to expand and diversify my knowledge and ability to work as an effective team member.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Testing Digital Solutions</h2>
    
    <p>
        I would follow prescribed testing procedures and also seek input from others. Its always possible to be so invested in your solution to a particular problem, that you can become blinkered. A fresh pair of eyes can often detect these problems.
